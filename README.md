# 4-javascript-quiz

### This website is a SUPER simple js quiz I threw together. I felt like this assignment really helped me understand the process javascript such as how js executes code line by line & how functions can be set up in js. However, this in no way implies I am an expert at js(as of now). There is still a good chunk of problems in this website I am aware of. A very obvious one I want to point out is the timer. A huge problem I ran into while working on this website was that alert()s & prompts()s actually stop the whole function of the page while on screen. Therefore, the timer I created will not run properly. Im sure there is a way to fix this, but from the research I have done I learned that using prompt & alert in general was not a good idea as their function is to litrally stop the function of the page. So, as of now I will upload what I have & if i can figure something out, or just scratch everything & restart before the Sunday deadline I will update this website. Until then, please do grade what I have. Link to website: https://itsmarcotime.github.io/4-javascript-quiz/
